# Rule Clarifications / House Rules

Monte Cook is the Todd Howard of RPG authors and Numenera is his Skyrim.

That is to say, it somehow manages to be an inconsistent, inscrutable mess despite being a third revision of the same book.  Hence this section.

Clarifications to Rules As Written (RAW) will be in plain text, while proposed house rules will be *italic*.  Ability names will be **bolded**.


## Use of Edge

Buried on page 25 of Discovery -- in the Character Creation section of all places FFS -- is this following gem of a paragraph that dramatically changes how you thought the game probably works:

> You can use Edge for a particular stat only once per action. For example, if you apply Effort to a Might attack roll and to your damage, you can use your Might Edge to reduce the cost of one of those uses of Effort, not both. If you spend 1 Intellect point to activate your mind blast and one level of Effort to ease the attack roll, you can use your Intellect Edge to reduce the cost of one of those things, not both.

No other example in the book ever mentions this, so if you missed it the first 4 times you read that section like I did, too bad.

The corollary to this rule stemming from "Edge for a particular stat" is that you can spend Edge from different pools for the same action, provided that each type of Edge spent applies only to one, though different, aspect of that action.

> e.g. A brand new tier 1 Glaive wishes to use **Fleet of Foot** to close distance with a broken hound and engage it in melee.  The Glaive also wants to apply a level of effort to ease the attack roll.  Because melee attacks can be either Might or Speed tasks, the Glaive opts to spend its 1 point of Speed Edge to pay the cost of the **Fleet of Foot** enabler, and then spend 1 point of Might Edge to discount the cost of Might Effort to damage for the Might-based attack action.

> e.g. A tier 2 Glaive wishes to use **Crushing Blow** to ensure that the attack kills their opponent outright.  Because **Crushing Blow** is a Might action, the Glaive can only use Might Edge on this task, and therefore Speed Edge will have to remain unused.


## Armor

### Armor Protection

If you're coming from a D&D background, you would probably assume that Armor only protects against physical damage.  This is not the case.  Specifically, on pages 109-110 of Discovery:

> Some types of damage ignore physical armor. Attacks that specifically deal Speed damage or Intellect damage ignore Armor ... Ambient damage ... usually ignores Armor as well.

This implies that Armor works against both physical and "energy" damage.  What is "energy" damage you might ask?  If you've taken a physics class before you might want to sit down for this, but "energy" is any elemental damage including things like "cold", as well as whatever "transdimensional energy" is.  Intuitively this makes some sense -- for instance, if someone were to hit you with a fireball, full plate would function as a heatsink and help dissipate the heat, while padding will work as an insulator.  However, just because armor helps you mitigate damage from an esotery doesn't mean that it also allows you to swim through, say, acid or lava.  This is why some artifacts explicitly mention that they provide environmental protection.


### Who Can Wear Armor?

The short answer is "anyone".  By default, armor penalizes Speed effort.  Thus, if you have no intention of applying Speed effort to any of your actions, it doesn't matter.  *However, people might find the idea of scrawny Nanos wearing full plate to be aesthetically displeasing, and so perhaps it would make sense for the GM to impose an encumbrance penalty on those not meeting some kind of Might pool requirement.  The default Glaive Might pool as a minimum requirement for medium armor may be a good starting point.*


## Skills

Skills in Numenera are exceptionally confusing, which is why this subsection has subsections.  *Generally, new skills should be about as broad as the ones listed on page 27 of Discovery, i.e. the broader the skill the less is the anticipated frequency of its usage.*

> e.g. **Heavy Bladed Attack** is very specific, but should come into play a lot.  **History** is very broad, but its usage is otherwise comparatively rare.


### Skill Stacking

RAW suggests that if you're trained in A as well as trained in B, if you're attempting a task that's at the intersection of A and B, you count as specialized in intersection(A and B).

> e.g. As a Delve who Explores Dark Places, you are automatically skilled in Searching, and you picked Perception as your starting skill.  Searching could be considered as a subset of the more general Perception, and thus you count as specialized in Searching tasks.


## Skill Training

Let's say you make a Graceful Delve.  As one of your lores, you choose **Skilled with Defense (Speed)**.  Can you do that?  Being Graceful already grants you that skill, and you cannot choose it again if you're already trained in it.  *However, the order in which descriptors apply is undefined, and thus it makes sense for the player to be able to choose the order, i.e. to choose Delve first and getting the lore, and then choosing Graceful for the implicit specialization.*

Now, let's say you have a Glaive who Explores Dark Places.  Tier 3 Explores Dark Places lets you be trained in Speed defense if you're wearing light or no armor.  Can you then also choose **Skilled with Defense (Speed)** as a tier 3 Glaive?  As per the skill stacking section, it would appear that you can, as these are actually distinct skills.

However, what about inabilities?  A Jack has an inability with heavy weapons, and a Glaive has an inability with Understanding Numenera.  What happens if they choose to invest in training in, say, heavy ranged and understanding numenera, respectively?  The rules are entirely unclear on this*, but it would make sense if the training would just cancel the inability -- or a subset of the inability in the first case -- and the player could still eventually progress to the equivalent of specialized, it just would be more expensive*.
See also: [Stacking Training](https://www.reddit.com/r/numenera/comments/aftgdq/inability_and_numenera_skills/ee1dk81/).

*Furthermore, wouldn't it be nice that if you picked a very narrow subset of a skill to be trained in, you would automatically specialize in it? e.g. instead of Crafting Numenera, you could pick Crafting Potions, and be immediately specialized?*

## Character Customization Options (Optional)

*Starting on page 331 of Discovery, these seem potentially fairly broken, and should only be used for flavor and a case-by-case GM's approval.  Stat pool and Edge customizations diminish the distinction between types, and correspondingly boost Jacks and non-Jacks. Customizing Foci allows a player to powergame some foci, as the replacement abilities can be straight-up upgrades, thus utmost discretion is advised.*

*Weaknesses and Inabilities look like fun though, especially since the latter allows character customization for flavor, e.g. picking a relatively insignificant skill in exchange for picking a similarly insignificant inability.*


## Touch Attacks

Oh man, I'm saving the best for last, so you might want to have a lie-down before tackling this.

Let us consider the tier 4 Nano ability **Slay**.  How does it actually work? "You gather disrupting energy in your fingertip and touch a creature", but this is an Intellect-based action while touching would seem to be a Might- or Speed-based attack, so what is really going on?

RAW being as helpful as they always are, state:

> Esoteries or effects that require touching the target require a melee attack. If the attack misses, the power is not wasted, and you can try again each round as your action until you hit the target, use another ability, or take a different action that requires you to use your hands. These attempts in later rounds count as different actions, so you don’t have to keep track of how much Effort you used when you activated the ability or how you used Edge. For example, let’s say that on the first round of combat, you activate an esotery, use Effort to ease the attack, and miss your foe. On the second round of combat, you can try attacking again and use Effort to ease the attack.

Because melee attacks are stated as being either Speed or Might based in the very previous paragraph, this seems to suggest that touch attacks are an exception to the rule that you can only use one type of pool per action. i.e. in theory you could pay some number of Intelligence points to activate **Slay**, and then ease your attack using your Might or Speed points*, but the rules don't explicitly say that you can do that.*

*It would make sense to allow it though.  Furthermore, it may make sense to use the original action pool to apply Effort to damage when applicable, while using either of the melee-appropriate pools for Effort to actually hit.*
*Moreover, it may make sense to distinguish between attacks to damage and to just hit, where if you choose to forgo damage from the physical attack the attack task is automatically eased an extra step.  This would be somewhat consistent with the D&D touch attack rules.  For touch attack abilities that just deal damage, it is likely most reasonable to apply the damages from the ability and the attack separately, so that armor would apply to both.*

This raises another question -- can touch attacks be made with weapons?  RAW don't say anything about this, but it should probably be at the Gamemaster's discretion:  e.g. an electric zap could be conducted with a rapier, but probably not with a wooden club.

***As a player, please consider your later tier abilities that may be ambiguous and discuss them with your Gamemaster so that you don't end up with any unpleasant surprises.***
